The crew of the Celestial Horizon had been traveling for nearly two decades, their ship a tiny speck in the grand tapestry of space. And then, without warning, they saw it - a strange, glowing vessel hovering at the edge of their sensor range. The aliens, tall and imposing with skin like dark, polished marble, emerged from the ship with an unnerving calm. They spoke in a language that sounded like music, their words weaving a spell of wonder and trepidation. As the crew struggled to comprehend the implications of this historic encounter, the aliens extended a gift - a small, crystalline orb that pulsed with an otherworldly energy. It was a gesture of peace, a symbol of their desire for unity in the face of an unfathomable universe. And as the Celestial Horizon's crew reached out to accept the offering, they knew that their world would never be the same.",

It was a simple series of pulses, rhythmic and deliberate, echoing through the vastness of space. Dr. Elara Voss, a leading astrobiologist, was the first to decode it. The message was not just noise; it was a greeting from Aeloria, a planet orbiting a distant sun.\n\nElara gathered her team, their hearts racing with excitement and fear. They had long speculated about life beyond Earth, but now they had proof. The Aelorians were curious beings, eager to learn about humanity. They proposed a meeting, a chance to bridge the gap between worlds.\n\nAs the spacecraft prepared for launch, Elara looked out at the stars, wondering what awaited them. Would they find friends or foes? With a deep breath, she stepped aboard, ready to make history. The journey to Aeloria was not just a leap into the unknown; it was the dawn of a new era for humankind.",

The signal was a series of mathematical sequences, unmistakably intelligent. A team was assembled, and a message was sent back. Days turned into weeks, and then, a reply. The aliens, calling themselves the Zorath, expressed a desire for peaceful contact. A holographic meeting was arranged. As the Zorath's image flickered to life, their appearance was both awe-inspiring and terrifying. They had elongated limbs, shimmering skin, and eyes that seemed to hold the secrets of the universe. Dr. Vasquez took a deep breath and stepped forward, extending a hand in greeting. The Zorath mirrored the gesture. In that moment, two civilizations, separated by light-years, began a journey of understanding and cooperation.",

### Complex calculation

Status: ✅ Success

#### Response:

```json
{
  "chain_of_thought": "1. Let's break down the expression and calculate step by step:\n\n   - 15 * 87 = 1,305\n   - 48 * 0.5 = 24\n   - 129 / 24 ≈ 5.375\n   - 1,305 + 5.375 = 1,310.375\n   - 1,310.375 + 12 = 1,322.375\n\n2. Now, let's solve the expression in the correct order of operations:\n\n   - First, calculate the parentheses: (129 / (48 * 0.5))\n     48 * 0.5 = 24\n     129 / 24 ≈ 5.375\n\n   - Next, multiply: 15 * 87 = 1,305\n\n   - Then, add the results:\n     1,305 + 5.375 + 12 = 1,322.375\n\n3. Therefore, the final result is 1,322.375",

The signal intensified, filling their instruments with an otherworldly symphony.\n\n'We're receiving a message,' Elena whispered, her voice trembling.\n\nAs the team huddled around the monitor, alien symbols cascaded across the screen. In that moment, humanity stood on the precipice of a new era. The stars had spoken, and Earth would never be the same.\n\nElena took a deep breath. First contact had begun.",
